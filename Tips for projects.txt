My learning objective was to understand how machine learning works, and how it could be implemented by a business user. Hence, I used low-code libraries where possible.

For supervised and unsupervised learning, I used PyCaret: https://pycaret.gitbook.io/docs/ On top of this, I chose a small and familiar dataset, which you can find here (though incorrectly labelled as "big data"): https://charityguidepoint.sg/ 

For deep learning, I used Tensorflow but read the documentation and experimented with variables. This is the low-code alternative: https://github.com/rafiqhasan/auto-tensorflow 

For the Capstone, all you need to do are the exercises across the whole module. They are not difficult, and contain the answers you need for your final presentation.

Good luck!
