"This credential earner is able to showcase working skills in the main areas of Machine Learning: Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Deep Learning, and Reinforcement Learning. The earner has also gained experience in specialized topics such as Time Series Analysis and Survival Analysis."

These are my labs in Python. Index numbers of folders indicate the course; those of files, the order they were handed out.

The 8-month course is delivered by IBM, and my participation was sponsored by the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA).
