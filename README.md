"This credential earner is able to showcase working skills in the main areas of Machine Learning ... [and] experience in specialized topics such as Time Series Analysis and Survival Analysis."

These are my labs in Python. Index numbers of folders indicate the course; those of files, the order they were handed out.

The 8-month course is delivered by IBM, and my participation was sponsored by the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA).
